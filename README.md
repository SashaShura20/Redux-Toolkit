# Conclusion on the work done: Redux Toolkit

## ðŸŽ¯ The results of mastering the Redux Toolkit

In the course of practical work, key health management skills were successfully consolidated using the modern Redux Toolkit approach.

### 1. Mastered concepts and tools
- **Creating a slice** using `createSlice` is a unified way to describe reducers and actions
- **Immutable updates** using `Immer.js ` - simplification of working with immutable state
- **Working with asynchronous operations** via 'createAsyncThunk`
- **Performance Optimization** using RTK Query to work with API
- **TypeScript typing** to improve code reliability

### 2. Implemented state architecture
``typescript
// Example of the store structure
const store = configureStore({
  reducer: {
    counter: counterSlice.reducer,
    users: usersSlice.reducer,
    api: apiReducer,
  },
  middleware: (getDefaultMiddleware) =>
    getDefaultMiddleware().concat(apiMiddleware),
});
